**03: __init__ Constructor**

A special method that runs automatically when an object is created.

**04: Self**

A keyword or parameter that refers to the current objects. it connects the code to the special data inside 
the box so methods can accesses it.

**05: Methods**

A function written inside a class. if defines the action or tasks that an object can perform.

Static methods are methods that don't use the self parameter(work at class level).\n
They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and can be called on the class itself without creating an instance.
